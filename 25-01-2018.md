Today features were implemented into garliyard such as two factor authentication for yubikeys, and various user interface tweaks.

## UI Tweaks
The user interface on the dashboard has been tweaked in the address area specifically to be more consistent with padding on the `col-md-9` or right column.  
Due to the size of the address window, there used to be a bit of padding.

There was also a few changes made to the frontend side of things for the QR Code Generation:
- QR Code Sizes are dynamic, with a default of 500px
- The URL window has been merged
- The icon is now in the bottom right of the address window.

## Two Factor Authentication
This is something that security freaks like [me](https://github.com/elycin/) enjoy.  
I haven't quite figured out how to work out time based two factor authentication, but for the time being you can now successfully login with a yubikey and OTP as a second factor.

## Performance Tweaks
- Added Redis Caching back to user balances with manual overrides
    - Decreased the `/home` page's load time by 20%
    - Significantly less JSONRPC calls
    
- Cached values will now remain for 3 minutes  
(This was done so more reqeusts could be made and we can use more cost effective hardware and less resources.)

## Account Maturity
I've implemented a feature to prevent spam.  
On estimate, it seems each address takes about 4KB of disk space, I've made it so that accounts less than an hour old can only have a maximum of 10 addresses, which will then move up to 100 addresses.

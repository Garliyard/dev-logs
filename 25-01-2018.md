Today features were implemented into garliyard such as two factor authentication for yubikeys, and various user interface tweaks.

## UI Tweaks
The user interface on the dashboard has been tweaked in the address area specifically to be more consistent with padding on the `col-md-9` or right column.  
Due to the size of the address window, there used to be a bit of padding.

There was also a few changes made to the frontend side of things for the QR Code Generation:
- QR Code Sizes are dynamic, with a default of 500px
- The URL window has been merged
- The icon is now in the bottom right of the address window.

## Two Factor Authentication
This is something that security freaks like [me](https://github.com/elycin/) enjoy.  
I haven't quite figured out how to work out time based two factor authentication, but for the time being you can now successfully login with a yubikey and OTP as a second factor.

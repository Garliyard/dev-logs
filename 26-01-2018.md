Today's contributions consist of implementing TOTP 2FA (Google Authenticator) and a few other security improvements.

## Confidentiality is important
With today's changes, address labels are now encrypted.  
The goal of this was to protect the label stored in the database in the event that a databreach does occur, 
that the attacker could not guess which addresses potentially valuable.

In the image below, for my personal wallet the address you see is labeled: `Transfer from personal wallet`.  
Inside the database below, you can see the raw data stored in the database.

## Moving servers soon
[Glypht](http://glypht.elyc.in/) (a single core) [Linode](https://linode.com) instance with 1GB of RAM will be phased out, 
and moved to another server with 12 Cores and 32 GB of RAM.

## TOTP/Google Authenticator 2FA
By the end of the day, we should have a stable implementatiaon of a time based password for Google Authenticcator.  
In the event that you decide to swtich to a hardware token such as the Yubikey, your TOTP method will be disabled in favor for that. 

## A new team member
